# EcomGateway: A Microservice-based E-commerce Gateway with Identity Server and Azure Service Bus Integration

## Introduction

The demand for e-commerce platforms has increased, requiring businesses to have scalable and secure online shopping applications. This project aims to create an e-commerce application using a microservices architecture, Identity Server, and Azure Service Bus integration. The microservices architecture will employ the N-Layer implementation with the Repository Pattern to break the application into independent components that can be easily managed and scaled. The application will use both Async and Sync communication between the microservices and will use Entity Framework Core with a SQL Server database for data management.

Identity Server will handle user authentication, authorization, and management, while Azure Service Bus will enable messaging and communication between the microservices. The e-commerce application will provide features such as product catalog management, shopping cart functionality, and order management.

The project will address non-functional requirements such as performance, security, availability, and reliability. By the end of the project, we aim to develop a robust and scalable e-commerce application that meets modern business requirements.

Overall, this project will showcase the benefits of microservices architecture, Identity Server, Azure Service Bus, N-Layer implementation, Repository Pattern, Async and Sync communication, and Entity Framework Core with a SQL Server database. The e-commerce application will provide a comprehensive solution for businesses of all sizes.
