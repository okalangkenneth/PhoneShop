## Project Description

The demand for scalable and secure e-commerce platforms has increased, making it essential for businesses to have robust backend systems. This backend project aims to create an e-commerce application using microservices architecture, Identity Server, and Azure Service Bus integration. The microservices architecture will employ the N-Layer implementation with the Repository Pattern to break the application into independent components that can be easily managed and scaled. The application will use both Async and Sync communication between the microservices and will use Entity Framework Core with a SQL Server database for data management.

This project emphasizes the importance of the backend architecture and focuses on building a solid foundation for a successful e-commerce platform. Identity Server will handle user authentication, authorization, and management, while Azure Service Bus will enable messaging and communication between the microservices. The e-commerce application will provide features such as product catalog management, shopping cart functionality, and order management.

The project will prioritize non-functional requirements such as performance, security, availability, and reliability, ensuring that the backend system can handle high traffic and provide a seamless user experience. By the end of the project, we aim to develop a robust and scalable e-commerce application that meets modern business requirements and showcases the benefits of microservices architecture, Identity Server, Azure Service Bus, N-Layer implementation, Repository Pattern, Async and Sync communication, and Entity Framework Core with a SQL Server database.

In summary, this backend project is a comprehensive solution for businesses of all sizes looking to build a scalable and secure e-commerce platform.

## Getting Started

Provide instructions for users to set up and run your project locally. Include any dependencies, environment variables, and configuration settings required. You can also provide a step-by-step guide to deploying your project to a production environment.

## Architecture Overview

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68539411/223565684-642f3c07-fdc7-4881-b000-70360f859577.png)

This diagram shows the different components of the e-commerce application and how they communicate with each other. Each of the microservices will have its own database. The microservices communicate with each other through RESTful APIs or message queues. The dotted lines indicate asynchronous while the solid lines indicate synchronous communication. The Identity Server provides a centralized authentication and authorization mechanism for the microservices ensuring that the application is secure and compliant. Azure Service Bus enables messaging and communication between the microservices, ensuring that the application is highly available and reliable.
The microservices will be designed using the N-Layer implementation with the Repository Pattern, ensuring that the business logic and data access layers are separated.
